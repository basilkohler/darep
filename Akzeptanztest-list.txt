Preparation (von Franz-Josef Elmer übernommen)
==============================================

1. Install the software in some place. In the tests described below invocations of the software is
denoted as data-repository even though something like
./<installation folder>/data-repository has to be entered.
2. Create a temporary folder somewhere else. In the tests it will be referred as <playground>.
If this folder already exists you have to delete its content.
3. Delete the directory .data-repository in you home folder as specied by the Java system
property user.home. With the help of Eclipse the value of this property can be found out by
opening the About dialog and clicking on the button named Conguration Details.
4. Change to <playground>.
It is assumed that all tests are executed in the order described in this document.

5. print empty list:
	data-repository list
6. expected output:
Name	Original Name	Timestamp	Number of Files	Size	Description

7. print empty list (pretty print):
8. expected output:
Name	| Original Name	| Timestamp	| Number of Files	| Size	| Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(0 data sets, 0 bytes in total)

9. Create a Test-file:
	touch test-file.txt
10. add it to the repository:
	data-repository add test-file.txt

11. Create a folder with two files:
	mkdir directory
	echo "test1" > directory/subfile1.txt
	echo "test2" > directory/subfile2.txt
12. add the directory to repository:
	data-repository add directory -d "this is a directory"

13. list the contents of the repository (pretty output):
	data-repository list -p

14. the following output is expected (*):

Name		| Original Name	| Timestamp	| Number of Files	| Size			| Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST-FILE.TXT	| test-file.txt	| <timestamp>	| 1			| <size of file 1>	| 
DIRECTORY	| directory	| <timestamp>	| 3			| <size of file 2>	| this is a directory
(2 data sets <size of file 1 + size of file 2> bytes in total)

15. list the contents of the repository (default output) (*):

Name	Original Name	Timestamp	Number of Files	Size	Description
TEST-FILE:TXT	test-file.txt	<timestamp>	1	<size of file>	
DIRECTORY	directory	<timestamp>	3	<size of file>	this is a directory


(*)
<timestamp> sollte erstellungsdatum entsprechen
<size of file 1>: dateigrösse von test-file.txt
<size of file 2>: dateigrösse von directory
